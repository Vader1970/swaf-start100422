    <h1>Cloth Jawa Vs Vinyl Jawa</h1>

    <p>
      Jawa was part of the original Star Wars 12 Back wave which were the first
      figures produced by Kenner for the Star Wars movie.
    </p>

    <p>
      Theres an interesting back story or two regarding the 1978 Kenner Star
      Wars Jawa action figure.
    </p>

    <p>
      This action figure was originally produced with a brown vinyl cape. In
      fact, if you have one of these vinyl caped Jawa figures youre probably
      looking at about a $2000.00 for a loose figure; and about $30,000 for one
      still mint on card.
    </p>

    <p>
      The reason for the high price is because the 1978 Star Wars Jawa from
      Kenner underwent a dramatic costume change the very next year. Apparently
      Kenner felt that the action figure buying public would feel cheated if
      they paid the same price ($1.99) for a tiny Jawa figure as they would for
      a larger Obi Wan Kenobi or Darth Vader action figure. So, they decided to
      break out the sewing kits for the 1979 version of the Jawa and gave them a
      cloth robe instead of vinyl hoping that the cloth robe would add more
      value to the figure for its $1.99 price.
    </p>

    <p>
      Back in 1978, there were so few Star Wars action figures that fans would
      snag up whatever they could find in hopes of trading up. Anyone from that
      era can tell you, it wasnt hard to find the Jawas as they would be the
      only ones left on the rack. On the other hand, die hard Star Wars fans who
      liked to make dioramas or scenes would grab up multiple Jawas to mimic the
      scenes where Luke first bought R2D2 and C3PO. Often fans would buy half a
      dozen of the Jawas. Those lucky few that took great care of them or left
      them mint in the box could fetch quite the great monetary prize now.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately if you have the cloth robe Jawa youre not as lucky. A loose
      cloth robe Jawa will sell for around $75.00-100.00, while one still in the
      packaging might sell for $450.00 to $500.00; though I have seen them sell
      for more in high grade condition.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given the astronomic prices of vinyl caped Jawas there now, of course,
      many fake Jawas out there so be careful if youre looking to buy one. Its
      probably best to only buy one that has been certified by a known expert.
      Anyone can buy a reproduction vinyl Jawa cape off of eBay now and stick on
      a Jawa figure and claim it as original. Some even try to cut down the
      vinyl cape that came with Ben Kenobi and fit it to a Jawa and claim it as
      original. An original Jawa cape should match the colour of the Jawa
      figure. Kenobi cape was a little darker.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the 12 Back cards have been reproduced as well its fairly easy to
      put together a fake vinyl cape Jawa. Some of the fake Jawas have incorrect
      blisters or bubbles. Below you can see three types of plastic bubble used
      to package Jawa.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bubble on the left is the only bubble that the vinyl caped Jawa came
      in. The other two bubbles were used on cloth Jawas but not on vinyl Jawas.
      So, if you see a vinyl Jawa in one of the two bubbles on the right then it
      is a fake Jawa.
