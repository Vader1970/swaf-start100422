    <h1>Rocket Firing Boba Fett</h1>

    <p>
      The famous Rocket Firing Boba Fett is the Holy Grail to majority of Star
      Wars Collectors.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 1978, Kenner started developing a Boba Fett that would fire a projector
      missile.
    </p>

    <p>
      People who collected the first <strong>Carded</strong> Star Wars figures
      released, were given the option to mail away 3 purchases of proof and they
      would be the very first customers to receive the new action figure (Boba
      Fett with a Rocket Firing Mechanism) from the new unseen movie The Empire
      Strikes Back.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kenner made 100 prototypes of the figure and they were shipped off to
      China for testing. These tests were quite extreme where the figures were
      tested at extreme high and very low temperatures. Only 27 survived and
      collectors have only been able to account for 24 of them.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, in the final stages of the development of the figure; a child had
      choked and died from having a BattleStar Galactica vehicle projectile
      missile lodge in his throat. Therefore Kenner decided not to have the
      firing mechanism and all the customers that had mailed in for the figure
      receive the figure with the rocket glued in place. The firing mechanism
      was completed taken away.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two major variants which exist and they are the L-Slot and
      J-Slot rocket firing mechanism. The J-Slot Boba Fett being the rarer of
      the two. A J-Slot Boba Fett graded at 50% quality just sold on
      www.Hakes.com website for an astounding $204,435.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each prototype figure was loose; however a carded one did show up at the
      Toy fair Expo. This was the only fully completed Rocket Firing Boba Fett
      ever made.
