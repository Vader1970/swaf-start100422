    <h1>Holy Grail</h1>

    <p>My Holy Grail is the Toltoys Darth Vader 12-Back, Mint on Card (MOC).</p>
    <p>
      I was very fortunate to obtain this figure as these figures are extremely
      rare to find and are the envy of all collectors. A lot of collectors from
      around the world wish to have a 12 Back Toltoys; especially still attached
      to its original card.

    <h2>
      The Story behind what was thought to be worthless toys; sold for $52,350
    </h2>

    <p>
      There were 6 out of a 11 of these rare figures up for auction on the
      TradeMe website in February 2022. To have six of these figures up for
      auction at the same time is very rare; if not non-existing at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      The story behind to how these figures appeared on TradeMe is extraordinary
      in itself. The owner of the figures, which was the mother, had just
      recently passed. A friend from way down South flew up North to help her
      friend clear and pack her mothers deceased things.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the daughter was going through her mothers things; she came across
      these 6 Star Wars figurines. Thinking they were worth nothing; she threw
      them into the rubbish. Her friend, who noticed this happen, asked if she
      could take the figurines back down South to give to her grandson. When she
      approached her grandson to give him the figures; he was not interested as
      they were not Fortnite.
    </p>

    <p>
      She was fortunate enough that another friend suggested that they may be
      worth something and she should put them on TradeMe. Therefore, she posted
      them on TradeMe with no idea how much they were worth. She posted them at
      a starting bid of $25 each. She was originally going to put them up for a
      $35 Buy Now.
    </p>

    <p>The six figures went for a total worth of $52,350.</p>
    <p>Luke Skywalker sold for $8,150 (image)</p>
    <p>Princess Leia sold for $6,050 (image)</p>
    <p>See-Threepio (C3P0) sold for $9,000 (image)</p>
    <p>Han Solo $10,000 (image)</p>
    <p>Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi $9,600 (image)</p>
    <p>Darth Vader $9,550 (which I won) (image)</p>

    <p>
      If these were auctioned on EBay, they would have most likely gone for
      three times that amount.

    <p>As the story goes: What is ones person rubbish; is anothers treasure.</p>

    <h2>Why are this Holy Grails so rare?</h2>
    
	<p>
      The main variant is the Toltoys logo on the front of the card; contrast to
      the more common one Kenner. Image

	<p>
      After the Early Bird set; the first 12 figures were released by Kenner on
      a 12 Back A Card. The first 12 were:
    </p>

    <p>Han Solo</p>
    <p>Chewbacca</p>
    <p>Princess Leia Organa</p>
    <p>Luke Skywalker</p>
    <p>See-Threepio (C3P0)</p>
    <p>Artoo-Detoo (R2D2)</p>
    <p>Darth Vader</p>
    <p>Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi</p>
    <p>Stormtrooper</p>
    <p>Death Squad Commander</p>
    <p>Sand People</p>
    <p>Jawa (image 12 Back A set)</p>

    <p>
      When Kenner produced their 3rd wave of figures called the 12 Back C (which
      has very slight difference of text on the back of the card between the
      three waves) they mailed loose figures to Hong Kong and Taiwan so as to
      save on shipping costs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The figures were then sent to Australia and were packaged in Australia
      under the Toltoys logo. Even though they were Kenner (USA) 12 Back C
      figures, the ones packaged in Australia are considered to be their 12 Back
      A Card.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sale of the Toltoys logo figures was exclusive to Australia and New
      Zealand only. Since there was only a limited amount of figures distributed
      to Australasia, there were only a limited amount of Toltoys figures
      packaged. Furthermore, Kiwi and Australian kids were very eager to rip the
      figure off its card so to play with it. Therefore, to find any MOC Toltoys
      is extremely rare.
