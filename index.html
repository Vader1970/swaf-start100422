      Kenner realised that they wouldnt be able to have any action figures
      available to the public before Christmas 1977. Star Wars - A New Hope had
      already been released and was a massive hit all over the world. Young
      children were waiting with great anticipation to get their hands on any
      action figurines.

      As an alternative, Kenner offered for sale an Early Bird Mail-Away
      Certificate where the purchaser could send the certificate in and was
      promised that they will be the very first people to receive Star Wars
      action figures. Therefore the very first Star Wars action figures were
      released in 1978 as part of the mail-away Star Wars Early Bird Kit, which
      contained Star Wars figures of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Chewbacca
      and R2-D2.

      The last figures in the series were released during the Power of the Force
      series in 1985, before Kenner released figures based on the Droids and
      Ewoks cartoon TV shows. After that there was a ten year break until Hasbro
      started to produce Star Wars figures again in 1995.

      Over the years Star Wars toys have been very popular with collectors from
      all over the globe. Collectors will now pay astounding amount of money to
      have an item within their collection. The rarer the item; the higher it
      will cost you to obtain it. There are even rarer variants of the same
      figure that have sold for enormous amount of money. Just an example is the
      J-Slot Firing Boba Fett graded at AFA 50, sold for $204,435 on Hakes.com
      auction March 16th, 2022.
