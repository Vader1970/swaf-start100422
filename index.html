                Kenner realised that they wouldnt be able to have any
                action figures available to the public before Christmas 1977.
                <strong>Star Wars</strong> - A New Hope had already been released and
                 was a massive hit all over the world. Young children were waiting with
                great anticipation to get their hands on any action figurines.
                </p>

            <p>
                As an alternative, Kenner offered for sale an
                <span class="bold"> Early Bird Mail-Away</span>
                Certificate where the purchaser could send the certificate in and was
                promised that they will be the very first people to receive Star Wars
                action figures. Therefore the very first Star Wars action figures were
                released in 1978 as part of the mail-away Star Wars Early Bird Kit,
                which contained Star Wars figures of
                <strong>Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Chewbacca</strong> and
                <strong>R2-D2.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                The last figures in the series were released during the Power of the
                Force series in 1985, before Kenner released figures based on the
                Droids and Ewoks cartoon TV shows. After that there was a ten year
                break until Hasbro started to produce Star Wars figures again in 1995.

                Over the years Star Wars toys have been very popular with collectors
                from all over the globe. Collectors will now pay astounding amount of
                money to have an item within their collection. The rarer the item; the
                higher it will cost you to obtain it. There are even rarer variants of
                the same figure that have sold for enormous amount of money. Just an
                example is the J-Slot Firing Boba Fett graded at AFA 50, sold for
