    <h1>Blue Snaggle Tooth</h1>

    <p>
      Blue Snaggletooth Released by Kenner in early 1978 as part of the Sears
      "Star Wars Cantina Adventure Set" as well as a Sears exclusive mail-in
      two-pack with Greedo, Hammerhead, Walrus Man, and the blue Snaggletooth,
      which is one of the rarest Star Wars action figures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, unlike his replacement, the taller Blue Snaggletooth was
      never sold singularly, tucked inside a plastic bubble attached to a
      cardback. Instead, you either had to purchase him as part of the Sears
      Cantina Adventure Set or a Mail Away.
    </p>

    <p>
      The blue Snaggletooth figure was intended to represent the character
      Zutton, however Kenner designer's only visual reference at the time was a
      partial black and white photograph of the character. As a result the Blue
      Snaggletooth figure wore a blue uniform, had long legs, and wore boots and
      gloves. When Star Wars hit the big screen in 1977, Kenners producers saw
      to their horror that Snaggletooth was short at 3ft tall and wore a red
      suit. Kenner quickly scrapped the blue-suited Snaggletooth and replaced
      him with the shorter and stouter red figure with bare feet and hands, but
      not before thousands of kids owned the inaccurate blue Snaggletooth.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 1979 the corrected red version of Snaggletooth was released, both in
      the Sears Cantina Adventure Set and as a carded figure.
    </p>

      The blue Snaggletooth was thus consigned to a special place in Star Wars
      action figure history. One more thing collectors will note: In addition to
      red versus blue versions, there is still another variant. Blue
      Snaggletooth can be found as either a “Dented Toe” or “Non-Dented Toe”
      variant. The indentation in one boot is most likely a manufacturing error.
